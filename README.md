# Hi! I'm Mari! 🇮🇹🇧🇷

I'm an 18-year-old student and aspiring software engineer from Italy. I'm currently completing five years of specialized studies at a Technical Institute for Informatics and Telecommunications, and in September 2026, I will be starting my degree in Computer Engineering at university.

This background has allowed me to build a solid foundation in everything from low-level logic with Assembly and C++ to versatile languages like Python, C#, and PHP. Beyond programming, I have experience managing databases and network infrastructures using HeidiSQL, XAMPP, Wireshark, and Cisco Packet Tracer. 

### Languages & Certifications
✨ **English:** Certified **B2** level (currently working towards **C1** certification). <br>
✨ **Portuguese (Brazilian):** Fluent. <br>
✨ **Italian:** Native speaker. <br>

### Projects & Leadership
As part of my school projects, I served as both **Project Manager and Developer** for two WordPress websites for my institute: one is already live ([ilvegni.it](https://ilvegni.it)), and the second is currently a work in progress, scheduled for completion by May 2026. I am passionate about combining technical leadership with the practical needs of real-world projects. I'm also working towards building my own website!

### Professional Experience (Internships)
I have actively expanded my skills through various internships (PCTO):
🎀 **Trust (Montepulciano):** Professional internship focusing on local tech infrastructure.<br>
🎀 **42 Firenze:** An intensive coding experience within the 42 Network's innovative learning ecosystem. (mostly python)<br>
🎀 **Barcelona (Upcoming):** I will soon be starting my third internship abroad in Spain to further enhance my international professional background.<br>

Always learning and ready for the next challenge, my motto is "non si smette mai di imparare"! ✨🎀
